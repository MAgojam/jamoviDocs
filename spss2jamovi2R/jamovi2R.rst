From jamovi to R
================

There are two possible ways of using R code together with jamovi. The first one
is based upon the use of the `jamovi-module Rj <jamovi-module_Rj.html>`__. The
other, more powerful one is based upon creating analyses within the jamovi user
interface, copying the syntax and using it inside R in connection with the
`R-library jmv <R-library_jmv.html>`__.

   R-library_jmv

Especially the latter option with direct access to R gives you access the
functionality of its built-in functions as well as to masses of R-libraries
dealing with (more or less) every statistical problem you can imagine.

To learn more about R you can use two excellent websites by `Danielle Navarro 
<https://djnavarro.net>`__. The first is `«Learning statistics with R» 
<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has psychology students who use R
in their first method course as the main target group. On this page you will
find a `PDF <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a `bookdown
<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ version that was the basis for
«Learning statistics with jamovi» (which is availble both as `part of this
documentation <../lsj/Prologue.html>`__ as well as `textbook in PDF format
<https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). The second resource, `R for
Psychological Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is still under construction and
more aimed at someone who already has taken at least one research method class
and would like to learn how to use the R programming language in their own
work. This site also has a strong focus on the `tidyverse methodology
<https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of `Hadley Wickham <http://hadley.nz>`__.
