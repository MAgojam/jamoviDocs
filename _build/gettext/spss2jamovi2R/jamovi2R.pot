msgid "There are two possible ways of using R code together with jamovi. The first one is based upon the use of the `jamovi-module Rj <jamovi-module_Rj.html>`__. The other, more powerful one is based upon creating analyses within the jamovi user interface, copying the syntax and using it inside R in connection with the `R-library jmv <R-library_jmv.html>`__."

msgid "Especially the latter option with direct access to R gives you access the functionality of its built-in functions as well as to masses of R-libraries dealing with (more or less) every statistical problem you can imagine."

msgid "To learn more about R you can use two excellent websites by `Danielle J. Navarro <https://djnavarro.net>`__. The first is `«Learning statistics with R» <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has psychology students who use R in their first method course as the main target group. On this page you will find a `PDF <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a `bookdown <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ version that was the basis for «Learning statistics with jamovi» (which is availble both as `web documentation <https://lsj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lsj/Prologue.html>`__ as well as `textbook in PDF format <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). The second resource, `R for Psychological Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is still under construction and more aimed at someone who already has taken at least one research method class and would like to learn how to use the R programming language in their own work. This site also has a strong focus on the `tidyverse methodology <https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of `Hadley Wickham <http://hadley.nz>`__."
