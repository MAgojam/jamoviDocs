msgid "This comparison shows how a t-test for independent samples is performed in SPSS and jamovi. How the test is conducted in SPSS follows the description in chapter 10.9 of `Field (2017) <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__, especially Figure 10.7 to 10.10 and Output 10.8 - 10.10. It uses the data file **Invisibility RM.sav** which can be downloaded from the `web page accompanying the book <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e/student-resources/datasets>`__."

msgid "The dataset describes a repeated-measures-design where first the “baseline”-number of mischieveous acts (during one week) is determined for each participant (variable ``No_Cloak``) before they are handed a cloak that makes them invisible. After receiving the cloak, the number of mischieveous acts is recorded for the following week (variable ``Cloak``) during which they can make themselves invisible (which is assumed to increase the number of mischieveous acts committed)."

msgid "In a first step, it demonstrates the calculation of the statistics underlying the t-test for paired samples. For this calculation, first, the average number of mischieveous acts for each person is calculated before a mean of these individual averages is calculated for the whole group. The individual is then adjusted for that group mean. The aim of this calculation is to show that by using repeated measurements, one can “control” for some proportion of the variance which is caused by individual differences in performance. In connection with this, the standard error of mean becomes smaller (which means that effects easier can become significant (as compared to a between-subjects design)."
