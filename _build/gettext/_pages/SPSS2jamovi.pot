msgid "Quite a few of us are so used to SPSS that we are a little scared to switch to another software because such transition and to get acquainted with a new software always takes time and effort. Now might be a good time to switch because SPSS is also introducing a `new interface <https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2017/10/23/newuipreviewspss>`__ with version 26 which at least requires getting used to something new and learn it. Why not take a little bigger step and learn jamovi? jamovi does not entail the high `license costs <https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics/pricing>`__ of SPSS (from $ 99 / month for the Base Package) and can be a first step on the road to R. jamovi tries to use an interface that is relatively similar to the one in SPSS, the result version is more transparent and can be easily transferred to text processing (copy-and-paste with [mostly] keep formatting)."
