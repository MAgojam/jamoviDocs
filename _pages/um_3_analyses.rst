Analyses
========

   Analyses can be selected from the analyses ribbon or menu along the top.
   Selecting an analysis will present an “options panel” for that particular
   analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of
   the analysis, and select different options. At the same time, the results
   for the analysis will appear in the right “results panel”, and will update
   as you make changes to the options.

   When you have the analysis set up correctly, you can dismiss the analysis
   options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the options panel. If you
   wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that were
   produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or say, a
   colleague) created earlier.

   jamovi produces nice APA formatted tables, and attractive plots. It is often
   useful to be able to copy and paste these, perhaps into a Word document, or
   into an email to a colleague. To copy results, right click on the object of
   interest, and from the menu select exactly what you want to copy. The menu
   allows you to choose to copy, say only the image, or the entire analysis.
   Selecting copy, copies the content to the clipboard, and can be pasted into
   the other program in the usual way.

   |copy-paste|

   If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it
   with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results will
   bring up a menu, and by selecting ``Analysis``, and then ``Remove``, the
   analysis can be removed.

   An overview with short, non-technical tutorials on how to do common
   procedures in jamovi can be found under `Analyses <jg_0_introduction.html>`__.
