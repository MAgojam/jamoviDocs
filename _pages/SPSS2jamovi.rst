===================
From SPSS to jamovi
===================

Quite a few of us are so used to SPSS that we are a little scared to switch to
another software because such transition and to get acquainted with a new
software always takes time and effort. Now might be a good time to switch
because SPSS is also introducing a `new interface 
<https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2017/10/23/newuipreviewspss>`__
with version 26 which at least requires getting used to something new and learn
it. Why not take a little bigger step and learn jamovi? jamovi does not entail
the high `license costs <https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics/pricing>`__
of SPSS (from $ 99 / month for the Base Package) and can be a first step on the
road to R. jamovi tries to use an interface that is relatively similar to the
one in SPSS, the result version is more transparent and can be easily
transferred to text processing (copy-and-paste with [mostly] keep formatting).

`Comparison of analyses <s2j_Comparison_of_analyses.html>`__ provides an
overview of which analysis functions are available in SPSS and the respective
functions in jamovi.

The pages in this section show in side-by-side comparisons how something is
done in SPSS and in jamovi. For this demonstration, the examples from Andy
Field's book are used.
