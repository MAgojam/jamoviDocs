================
From jamovi to R
================

There are two possible ways of using R code together with jamovi. The first one
is based upon the use of the `jamovi-module Rj <Rj_overview.html>`__. The
other, more powerful one is based upon creating analyses within the jamovi user
interface, copying the syntax and using it inside R in connection with the
`R-library jmv <jmv_overview.html>`__.

Especially the latter option with direct access to R gives you access the
functionality of its built-in functions as well as to masses of R-libraries
dealing with (more or less) every statistical problem you can imagine.

To learn more about R you can use two excellent websites by `Danielle J. Navarro 
<https://djnavarro.net>`__. The first is `«Learning statistics with R» 
<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has psychology students who use R
in their first method course as the main target group. On this page you will
find a `PDF <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a `bookdown
<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ version that was the basis for
«Learning statistics with jamovi» (which is availble both as `web documentation
<https://lsj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lsj/Prologue.html>`__ as well as
`textbook in PDF format <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). 
The second resource, `R for Psychological Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is
still under construction and more aimed at someone who already has taken at
least one research method class and would like to learn how to use the R
programming language in their own work. This site also has a strong focus on
the `tidyverse methodology <https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of `Hadley Wickham
<http://hadley.nz>`__.
