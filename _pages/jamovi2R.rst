============
jamovi and R
============

There are a few ways to use jamovi and R together. The first is to use of the `Rj Editor <Rj_overview.html>`__, a module available from the jamovi library that allows executing R code from within jamovi.

Another is to use the :doc:`jmv R package <jmv_overview>` which makes all the analyses included with jamovi available from an interactive R session (such as in RStudio). jamovi can also provide the equivalent R syntax for each analysis with :doc:`Syntax mode <um_6_syntax_mode>`.
