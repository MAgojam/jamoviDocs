Introduction
============

   Welcome to the developer hub for `jamovi <https://www.jamovi.org>`__.

   Here you will find resources that cover the development of analyses for jamovi
   (and R). It’s still a work in progress, and we’ll be adding to it over time.

   If you have questions about developing modules for jamovi, or feedback on
   how we can improve the developer hub, we’re keen to hear from you. There are
   forums available at `forum.jamovi.org <https://forum.jamovi.org>`__, a
   communication platform at `jamovi.slack.com <jamovi.slack.com>`__ or you can
   reach out via e-mail to `contact <at> jamovi.org <mailto:contact@jamovi.org>`.
