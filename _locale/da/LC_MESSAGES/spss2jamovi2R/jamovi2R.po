"There are two possible ways of using R code together with jamovi. The "
"first one is based upon the use of the `jamovi-module Rj <jamovi-"
"module_Rj.html>`__. The other, more powerful one is based upon creating "
"analyses within the jamovi user interface, copying the syntax and using "
"it inside R in connection with the `R-library jmv "
"<R-library_jmv.html>`__."

"Especially the latter option with direct access to R gives you access the"
" functionality of its built-in functions as well as to masses of "
"R-libraries dealing with (more or less) every statistical problem you can"
" imagine."

"To learn more about R you can use two excellent websites by `Danielle J. "
"Navarro <https://djnavarro.net>`__. The first is `«Learning statistics "
"with R» <https://learningstatisticswithr.com/>`__ and has psychology "
"students who use R in their first method course as the main target group."
" On this page you will find a `PDF "
"<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/lsr-0.6.pdf>`__ and a `bookdown "
"<https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/>`__ version that was the basis"
" for «Learning statistics with jamovi» (which is availble both as `web "
"documentation <https://lsj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lsj/Prologue.html>`__"
" as well as `textbook in PDF format "
"<https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__). The second resource, `R for "
"Psychological Science <https://psyr.org>`__, is still under construction "
"and more aimed at someone who already has taken at least one research "
"method class and would like to learn how to use the R programming "
"language in their own work. This site also has a strong focus on the "
"`tidyverse methodology <https://www.tidyverse.org>`__ of `Hadley Wickham "
"<http://hadley.nz>`__."
