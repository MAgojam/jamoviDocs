"The below example shows an option with the name ``plotError``. This option "

"To achieve this two properties will need to be added to the ``RadioButton`` "
"definition ``optionName`` and ``optionPart``. Both these properties are "
"inherited from ``OptionControl``. As has been described in ``OptionControl``"
" documentation, ``optionName`` is used to determine what option the "
"``RadioButton`` should bind to. Under normal circumstances, it is not "
"necessary to use ``optionName`` as the property ``name`` can be used for the"
" same effect. This however, becomes a problem for defining a ``RadioButton``"
" that is linked to an ``List`` as the ``name`` property also has the "
"requirement to be unique to that UI control. It is not allowed to have two "
"radio buttons (or any other control for that matter) with the same name. "
"Because of this, when binding to an ``List`` with a ``RadioButton`` we are "
"required to give that ``RadioButton`` a unique name and use the "
"``optionName`` to bind to the desired ``List``."

msgid ""
"Now binding solely to a ``List`` is not a valid configuration for a "
"``RadioButton`` as it requires a boolean data type to operate correctly. To "
"overcome this, the ``RadioButton`` definition will need to not *just* bind "
"to the ``List`` but also to one of the sub-options. This is achieved using "
"the ``optionPart`` property. By assigning the name of the desired sub-option"
" to this property, the ``RadioButton`` will operate base on that sub-options"
" name."
