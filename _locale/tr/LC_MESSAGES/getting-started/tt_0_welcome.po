"A quite essential part of a statistical analysis actually happens before we "
"conduct them. That part is concerned with cleaning you data in order to "
"fulfil the assumptions required to run most inference-statistical "
"procedures. At the core of \"cleaning you data\" is the search for and the "
"removal of outliers. Using `filters <Filtering_data_with_jamovi>`__ can help"
" you with that task."

"One of the aims when cleaning outliers is that they might lead to violations"
" of assumptions for parametric statistical tests: normality (and possibly "
"linearity; due to floor and ceiling effects). I will briefly introduce how "
"we can conduct two preliminary checks to assess whether the assumptions for "
"conducting our main analyses are met: The first is to check whether the data"
" are in accordance with a `normal distribution "
"<Checking_normality_with_jamovi>`__, the other one is to assess whether the "
"independent and the dependent variables stand in a `linear relation "
"<Checking_linearity_with_jamovi>`__."
