"Quite a few of us are so used to SPSS that we are a little scared to "
"switch to another software because such transition and to get acquainted "
"with a new software always takes time and effort. Now might be a good "
"time to switch because SPSS is also introducing a `new interface "
"<https://developer.ibm.com/predictiveanalytics/2017/10/23/newuipreviewspss>`__"
" with version 26 which at least requires getting used to something new "
"and learn it. Why not take a little bigger step and learn jamovi? jamovi "
"does not entail the high `license costs <https://www.ibm.com/products"
"/spss-statistics/pricing>`__ of SPSS (from $ 99 / month for the Base "
"Package) and can be a first step on the road to R. jamovi tries to use an"
" interface that is relatively similar to the one in SPSS, the result "
"version is more transparent and can be easily transferred to text "
"processing (copy-and-paste with [mostly] keep formatting)."
