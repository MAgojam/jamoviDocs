"Calls to ``jmvtools::install()`` produce a file with the extension "
"``.jmo`` in the current working directory. This file *is* your module, "
"and can be distributed to other people, to ‘side-load’. This is a good "
"way to distribute your module during testing, where you might want to "
"send it to a handful of people. People can side-load modules from within "
"the jamovi store (accessible from a menu at the top right of jamovi)."
