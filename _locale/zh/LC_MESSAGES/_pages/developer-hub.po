msgid ""
"In the past, we’re had a number of difficulties with dependency "
"resolution for jamovi modules. Sometimes jmvtools would install more "
"dependencies than were necessary, and other times not enough. This "
"stemmed from contamination of the R library path, from R packages "
"installed on the system. In this release we’ve successfully isolated the "
"system libraries from the jmvtools, and only the required dependencies "
"will now be installed."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/developer-hub.rst:99
msgid ""
"Previously, .u.yaml files (the UI definition) were automatically "
"generated from .a.yaml files (the analysis definition). This was "
"sometimes problematic when additional changes were made to the .a.yaml "
"files. It wasn’t always clear which changes should be propagated to the "
".u.yaml files, and which should not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/developer-hub.rst:105
msgid ""
"In the 0.7.3, the .a.yaml and .u.yaml files work together. The .u.yaml "
"file, by default, contains minimal information (mostly just describing "
"the layout), and the property values, for example labels, are taken "
"directly from the .a.yaml file. For many people, they will only need to "
"edit the .a.yaml file, and jmvtools can take care of the .u.yaml file "
"itself. More documentation for UI Design will be coming soon."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
".u.yaml files using this new scheme will have the ``jus``, near the top "
"of the file, specified as ``2.0``. .u.yaml files using the older ``jus`` "
"of ``1.0`` will be automatically upgraded. Upgraded files will be placed "
"in ``tame`` ``compilerMode`` (explained next), you may want to change it "

"jmvtools also introduces a new option in .u.yaml files: ``compilerMode``."
" By default, .u.yaml files are created in ``aggressive`` mode. This means"
" that jmvtools will take a heavy handed approach when updating the "
".u.yaml files. If new options are added to the .a.yaml file, it will "
"aggressively add them into the .u.yaml file, overwriting any manual "
"changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/developer-hub.rst:127
msgid ""
"In contrast, the ``compilerMode`` of ``tame`` does not overwrite manual "
"changes in the u.yaml. The trade off is that it often can’t position UI "
"elements as optimally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_pages/developer-hub.rst:131
msgid ""
"We recommend beginning with your .u.yaml files in ``aggressive`` "
"``compilerMode``, and when you begin to refine your UI by adding custom "
"changes to your .u.yaml files swap over to ``tame`` ``compilerMode`` so "
"that your changes are preserved. Again, for a lot of people, "
"``aggressive`` mode will be all that they will ever need."

"For the time being, changes to the .a.yaml and/or the .u.yaml files, will"
