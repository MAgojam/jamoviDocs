"The below example shows an option with the name ``plotError``. This "

"To achieve this two properties will need to be added to the "
"``RadioButton`` definition ``optionName`` and ``optionPart``. Both these "
"properties are inherited from ``OptionControl``. As has been described in"
" ``OptionControl`` documentation, ``optionName`` is used to determine "
"what option the ``RadioButton`` should bind to. Under normal "
"circumstances, it is not necessary to use ``optionName`` as the property "
"``name`` can be used for the same effect. This however, becomes a problem"
" for defining a ``RadioButton`` that is linked to an ``List`` as the "
"``name`` property also has the requirement to be unique to that UI "
"control. It is not allowed to have two radio buttons (or any other "
"control for that matter) with the same name. Because of this, when "
"binding to an ``List`` with a ``RadioButton`` we are required to give "
"that ``RadioButton`` a unique name and use the ``optionName`` to bind to "
"the desired ``List``."

msgid ""
"Now binding solely to a ``List`` is not a valid configuration for a "
"``RadioButton`` as it requires a boolean data type to operate correctly. "
"To overcome this, the ``RadioButton`` definition will need to not *just* "
"bind to the ``List`` but also to one of the sub-options. This is achieved"
" using the ``optionPart`` property. By assigning the name of the desired "
"sub-option to this property, the ``RadioButton`` will operate base on "
"that sub-options name."
