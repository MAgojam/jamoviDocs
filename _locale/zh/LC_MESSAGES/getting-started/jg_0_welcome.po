"The aim of the jamovi guide is to provide short, non-technical tutorials "
"on how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. However, it is"
" not a resource providing an in-depth introduction into the background of"
" those procedures. For such an endevaour, there are plenty of other "
"resources, e.g «learning statistics with jamovi» (which is both `part of "
"this documentation <../lsj/Prologue.html>`__ as well available `as a PDF "
"textbook <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__."

"The t-test is used to test whether the mean value in a normally "

"The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines "
"how the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) "
"variable. These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. "
"Typically, such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with "
"or without treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose "
"influence one would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The "
"analysis of variance is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test,"
" but it goes beyond that, in that factors can have several levels "
"(t-tests only allow two) and in that several factors can be examined "
"simultaneously. An introduction into the concept of an ANOVA is presented"
" in this `video "
"<https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcbMG6sizXs?list=PLkk92zzyru5OAtc_ItUubaSSq6S_TGfRn>`__."

"Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing"
" the relationships between a dependent / outcome variable and one or more"
" independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis "
"examines the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome "
"variable, *regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well "
"can one or more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a "
"distinction is made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic "
"regression). An introduction into the concept of regression analyses is "
"presented in this `video "

"A quite essential part of a statistical analysis actually happens before "

"to fulfil the assumptions required to run most inference-statistical "
"procedures. It relies on information we gathered during the `descriptive-"
"statistical analysis <jg_1_descriptive-analyses.html>`__. It provides "
"information for the search for and the removal of outliers, which is at "
"the core of \"cleaning your data\". Using `filters "

"Among the aims when cleaning outliers is that outliers might lead to "
"violations of the assumptions for parametric statistical tests: normality"
" (and possibly linearity). I will briefly introduce how we can conduct "
"two preliminary checks to assess whether the assumptions for conducting "
"our main analyses are met: The first is to check whether the data are in "
"accordance with a `normal distribution "
"<jg_92_Checking_normality.html>`__, the other one is to assess whether "
"the independent and the dependent variables stand in a `linear relation "
"<tt_93_Checking_linearity.html>`__."
