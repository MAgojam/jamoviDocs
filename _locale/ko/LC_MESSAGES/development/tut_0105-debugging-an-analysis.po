"In this example, our code is only one line of code, so we can be "
"reasonably confident where the problem lies. However, in practice "
"software can be two or three or even more lines of code. In more complex "
"situations, it can be handy to have a ‘stack trace’ which tells us where "
"the problem occurred. jamovi can be placed in ‘dev mode’, which displays "
"stack traces when errors occur. dev mode can be toggled from the app menu"
" to the top right of the jamovi window:"
