"One way to use this information is for assessing whether the data meet the "
"assumptions that are required to run most inference-statistical procedures. "
"There are two checks that are central for assessing whether those "
"assumptions are met: The first evaluates whether the data are in accordance "
"with a normal distribution, the other assesses whether the independent and "
"the dependent variables stand in a linear relation. If the assumptions are "
"not met, this is often due to outliers in your data. Based upon the "
"information we gathered, it becomes possible to search for and to remove "
"such outliers. Using `filters <_pages/jg_18_Filtering_data.html>`__ can help "
"you with that task."

"The Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that examines how "
"the impact of one or more factors affects an outcome (dependent) variable. "
"These factors are the predictor variables and are categorical. Typically, "
"such factors reflect an experimental manipulation (e.g. with or without "
"treatment), but a factor can also represent groups for whose influence one "
"would like to control (e.g. gender: men or women). The analysis of variance "
"is based on a concept similar to that of the t-test, but it goes beyond "
"that, in that factors can have several levels (t-tests only allow two) and "
"in that several factors can be examined simultaneously."

"Correlation and regression analyses are statistical methods for assessing "

"independent / predictor variables. While the *correlation* analysis examines "
"the *relationship* between one predictor and one outcome variable, "
"*regression* analysis mainly focuses on *prediction* (how well can one or "
"more variables predict another (outcome) variable). Often, a distinction is "
"made between linear and non-linear (e.g., logistic regression)."
