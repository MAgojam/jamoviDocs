"UIs for jamovi analyses are defined in the .u.yaml file (a refresher on "
"the files and the relationship between them is described `here <tut_0103"
"-creating-an-analysis.html>`__). This describes what sort of control each"
" option is represented by (i.e. a dropdown list, or some radio buttons), "
"and the order and the layout in which they will appear."

"By default, .u.yaml files are in ``aggressive`` compiler mode. This means"
" when installing jamovi modules with ``jmvtools::install()`` the .u.yaml "
"files are regenerated and replaced each time. This is good early on in "
"the development process, but as development progresses, getting a UI "
"*just right* or adding custom behaviour requires hand editing of the "
".u.yaml files. To prevent jmvtools from simply replacing all your "
"changes, the .u.yaml file can be placed in ``tame`` mode. In ``tame`` "
"mode the compiler respects your changes, and will not interfere with your"
" adjustments. The trade-off is that the compiler often can’t insert new "
"controls into the UI as optimally."

"As we’ve seen earlier in this tutorial series with our t-test example, "
"each option is represented by one or more controls. Our list option was "
"represented by a list box, boolean options were represented by "
"checkboxes, and Variable options were represented as a box that variables"
" could be dragged to."

"As can be seen, controls are arranged in a hierarchy. At the very top is "
"a control of type ``VariableSupplier``. It has two children: ``deps`` of "
"type ``VariablesListBox`` and ``group`` of type ``VariableListBox``. "
"Together, these three controls create the variables list, and the "
"‘Dependent Variables’ and ‘Grouping Variable’ drop targets."
