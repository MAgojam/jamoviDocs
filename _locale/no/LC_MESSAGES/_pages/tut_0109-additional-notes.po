"``jmvtools::install()`` also downloads all your packages dependencies "
"(listed in ``DESCRIPTION``), and bundles them into your module. This "
"ensures that the module has everything it needs, and also that a module "

"reproducibility given how inexpensive disk space is."

"your analyses, and results appearing for the first time), and can lead to"
" a significant reduction in the amount of RAM your module uses."
