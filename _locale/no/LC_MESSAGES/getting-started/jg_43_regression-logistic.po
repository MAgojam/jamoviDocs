"You need one continuous predictor variable and one categorical (nominal or "
"ordinal) outcome variable. Make sure that the `measurement levels are set "
"correctly <um_2_first-steps.html#data-variables>`_ so that the predictor "
"variable(s) are marked as |continuous| and the outcome variable is marked as"
" |nominal|."

"Logistic regression can be found by selecting ``Analyses`` → ``Regression``."
" If the outcome variable is nominal (as in the above image), select ``2 "
"Outcomes`` if it has 2 outcomes, or ``N outcomes`` if it has *more* than 2 "
"outcomes. If the outcome variable is ordinal (e.g. low, medium, high), "
"select ``Ordinal Outcomes``."
