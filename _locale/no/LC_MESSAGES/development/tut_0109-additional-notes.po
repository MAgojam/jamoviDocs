"``jmvtools::install()`` also downloads all your packages dependencies "
"(listed in ``DESCRIPTION``), and bundles them into your module. This ensures"
" that the module has everything it needs, and also that a module will always"
" use predictable dependency versions. This results in larger module file "
"sizes, but arguably is a small price to pay for reproducibility given how "
"inexpensive disk space is."

"This improves start-up time (the delay between a user selecting one of your "
"analyses, and results appearing for the first time), and can lead to a "
"significant reduction in the amount of RAM your module uses."
