"At this point some of you might be wondering if this is a “real” hypothesis "
"test, or just a toy example that I made up. It’s real. In the previous "
"discussion I built the test from first principles, thinking that it was the "
"simplest possible problem that you might ever encounter in real life. "
"However, this test already exists. It’s called the *binomial test*, and it’s"
" implemented by jamovi as one of the statistical analyses available when you"
" hit the ‘Frequencies’ button. To test the null hypothesis that the response"
" probability is one-half ``p = 0.5``,\\ [#]_ and using data in which ``x = "
"62`` of ``n = 100`` people made the correct response, available in the "
"``binomialtest.omv`` data file, we get the results shown in :numref:`fig-"
"binomialtest`."

"Right now, this output looks pretty unfamiliar to you, but you can see that "
"it’s telling you more or less the right things. Specifically, the *p*-value "
"of 0.02 is less than the usual choice of *α* = 0.05, so you can reject the "
"null. We’ll talk a lot more about how to read this sort of output as we go "
"along, and after a while you’ll hopefully find it quite easy to read and "
"understand."

"Note that the ``p`` here has nothing to do with a *p* value. The ``p`` "
"argument in the jamovi binomial test corresponds to the probability of "
"making a correct response, according to the null hypothesis. In other words,"
" it’s the *θ* value."
