"There’s one last thing I want to point out before finishing. It’s something "
"that a lot of people find kind of surprising, but it’s worth knowing about. "
"An ANOVA with two groups is identical to the Student *t*-test. No, really. "
"It’s not just that they are similar, but they are actually equivalent in "
"every meaningful way. I won’t try to prove that this is always true, but I "
"will show you a single concrete demonstration. Suppose that, instead of "
"running an ANOVA on our ``mood.gain ~ drug`` model, let’s instead do it "
"using ``therapy`` as the predictor. If we run this ANOVA we get an "
"*F*-statistic of F(1,16) = 1.71, and a *p*-value = 0.21. Since we only have "
"two groups, I didn’t actually need to resort to an ANOVA, I could have just "
"decided to run a Student *t*-test. So let’s see what happens when I do that:"
" I get a *t*-statistic of t(16) = -1.3068 and a *p*-value = 0.21. Curiously,"
" the *p*-values are identical. Once again we obtain a value of *p* = 0.21. "
"But what about the test statistic? Having run a *t*-test instead of an "
"ANOVA, we get a somewhat different answer, namely t(16) = -1.3068. However, "
"there is a fairly straightforward relationship here. If we square the "
"*t*-statistic then we get the *F*-statistic from before: -1.3068² = 1.7077"
