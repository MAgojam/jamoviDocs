"As we discussed earlier in Section `Effect size, sample size and power "
"<Ch09_HypothesisTesting_08.html#effect-size-sample-size-and-power>`__, it’s "
"becoming commonplace to ask researchers to report some measure of effect "
"size. So, let’s suppose that you’ve run your χ²-test, which turns out to be "
"significant. So you now know that there is some association between your "
"variables (independence test) or some deviation from the specified "
"probabilities (goodness-of-fit test). Now you want to report a measure of "
"effect size. That is, given that there is an association or deviation, how "
"strong is it?"

"There are several different measures that you can choose to report, and "
"several different tools that you can use to calculate them. I won’t discuss "
"all of them but will instead focus on the most commonly reported measures of"
" effect size."

"By default, the two measures that people tend to report most frequently are "
"the *ϕ* statistic and the somewhat superior version, known as Cramér’s *V*."

"Mathematically, they’re very simple. To calculate the *ϕ* statistic, you "
"just divide your *X*\\² value by the sample size, and take the square root:"

"The idea here is that the *ϕ* statistic is supposed to range between 0 (no "
"association at all) and 1 (perfect association), but it doesn’t always do "
"this when your contingency table is bigger than 2 · 2, which is a total "
"pain. For bigger tables it’s actually possible to obtain *ϕ* > 1, which is "
"pretty unsatisfactory. So, to correct for this, people usually prefer to "
"report the *V* statistic proposed by `Cramer (1946) "
"<References.html#cramer-1946>`__. It’s a pretty simple adjustment to *ϕ*. If"
" you’ve got a contingency table with *r* rows and *c* columns, then define "
"*k* = min(*r*, *c*) to be the smaller of the two values. If so, then "
"**Cramér’s V** statistic is:"

"And you’re done. This seems to be a fairly popular measure, presumably "
"because it’s easy to calculate, and it gives answers that aren’t completely "
"silly. With Cramer’s V, you know that the value really does range from 0 (no"
" association at all) to 1 (perfect association)."
