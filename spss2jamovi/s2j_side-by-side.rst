Side-by-Side Comparison of Analyses
===================================

    The majority of users and institutions migrating to jamovi previously used
    SPSS. jamovi's interface, although in many ways quite different, should
    feel immediately familiar to people who have used SPSS before. To further
    ease a transition from SPSS to jamovi, the following pages provide a
    side-by-side comparison of how common analyses are carried out in SPSS and
    in jamovi. For those demonstration, the examples from `Andy Field's (2017)
    <https://edge.sagepub.com/field5e>`__ book are used.
